    Add CORS middleware to the FastAPI app instance.

    This function configures how the FastAPI application handles
    cross-origin requests by adding CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    middleware to the FastAPI app instance. It defines which origins are
    allowed to access resources, what methods can be used when accessing
    the resources, and which headers can be used during the request.

    Parameters:
    app (FastAPI): The FastAPI application instance to which the middleware will be added.

    Returns:
    FastAPI: The FastAPI application instance after adding the middleware.
